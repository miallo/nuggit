# Working with others

Git on its own is a nice tool, but the real strength comes from when you interact with others. And since they (mostly) don't always sit beside you at the same computer, one alternative would be to send over the files via email. That would get messy very fast and it also does not scale that well to many people, so git has a builtin way to interact with servers that can store all the code and make it accessible to other people.

# Pushing changes

To publish your local changes for a branch that the server already knows about, just run

```sh
git push
```
