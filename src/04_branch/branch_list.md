## List branches

If you want to get an overview on the available branches you can run

```sh
git branch
```

to see all your local branches. The current branch will be highlighted in green and marked with an asterisk.

Usually there is a "main" branch (in older repositories it might be called "master"), where all the finished tasks (e.g. implemented features) are collected. In this repository it was the branch you started from.

Hint: Do you maybe see another branch that you did not know before in the output of the command above? And can you maybe use one of the previous commands that you learned about and combine it with the new information?
