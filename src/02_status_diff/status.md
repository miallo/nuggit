One of the most used git commands is `git status` to see the current state (as in: Do I have uncommitted changes? Do I have changes locally that are not synced yet with the server ("pushed")?)

Another important tool is `git diff` that by default without further parameters shows the difference between the "working directory" (the files as you see them) and the "staging area" (the things you prepared to commit next), so basically the changes that would be left out from. In other words: it shows only the difference to what would be committed next.
