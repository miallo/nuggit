# Git basics

As a version control system Git can take snapshots of your code, so that you can e.g. go back in the history of a file. These snapshots are called "commits" and we will come back to them soon!

A repository (often called "repo") is a folder where one of your projects lives. In the context of Git, it's a folder that contains all your project's files, along with the complete history of changes made to those files. This includes code, documentation, configuration files, and a hidden .git directory containing all the meta data and history (we might take a closer look later into it, but that is quite advanced). Repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (on platforms like GitHub, Codeberg, GitLab, â€¦), making it easy to collaborate with others and manage changes over time.
