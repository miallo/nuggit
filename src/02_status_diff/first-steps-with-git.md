# Git basics

As a version control system Git can take snapshots of your code, so that you can e.g. go back in the history of a file. These snapshots are called "commits" and we will come back to them soon!

A repository (often called "repo") is a folder where one of your projects lives. In the context of Git, it's a folder that contains all your project's files, along with the complete history of changes made to those files. This includes code, documentation, configuration files, and a hidden .git directory containing all the meta data and history (we might take a closer look later into it, but that is quite advanced). Repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (on platforms like GitHub, Codeberg, GitLab, …), making it easy to collaborate with others and manage changes over time.
